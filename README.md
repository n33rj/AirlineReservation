# Abstract
The Airline Reservation System helps airlines to manage ticket bookings. The airline  staff can book tickets for the customer and the customer can view their tickets by logging into their account. This application aims to develop a basic interface for airline reservation that implements functionality like user management, login, verifying username and password, ticket booking, saving ticket information and viewing the tickets. With user verification and ability to save ticket across logins, the java application presents a simple system for airline reservation. After integrating a database for the tickets and implementing encrypted login, this application can also be developed as a web server for online bookings.
